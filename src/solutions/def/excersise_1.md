### JS

#### v3

This is just a playground to test different individual performance optimizations. v3() is the base method.

- 3.1: Using `for` loop instead of `forEach` loop
- 3.2: Using booleans instead of numbers to store the result
- 3.3: Using `Map` instead of `Object` to store the frequency of each element
- 3.4: Using `else` instead of `=== false` or `!value`
- 3.5: Combined `for` with `Map`

The only one better than no optimizations is 3.1 with for loops.

#### v2

The main idea behind this optimization is to use a map data structure to store
 the frequency of each element in the input array, instead of creating a unique
 array and filtering the input array for each element. This reduces the time
 complexity from O(n^2) to O(n), where n is the length of the input array. The
 space complexity is also reduced from O(n) to O(k), where k is the number of
 unique elements in the input array.

```js
const map = new Map()
const result = []
// Loop through the input array once and store the frequency of each element
for (let num of input) {
  map.set(num, (map.get(num) || 0) + 1)
}

// Loop through the map and push the keys with odd values to the result array
for (let [key, value] of map) {
  if (value % 2 == 1) result.push(key)
}

return result
```

#### v1

Initial solution, which creates an array of unique items then counts occurences of it in the input array.

```js
const uniqueArr = [...new Set(input)]
const result = []

uniqueArr.forEach((item) => {
  const count = input.filter((val) => val === item).length
  if (count % 2 == 1) result.push(item)
})

return result
```
